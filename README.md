BRO… BRO… *BRO…* YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND… GOJO’S HOLLOW PURPLE ISN’T JUST A TECHNIQUE—IT’S A *LIFESTYLE* 😫🙏✨ THE WAY HE FLEXES THOSE SIX EYES… THE WAY HE *MOCKS* DISASTER CURSES LIKE IT’S A TUESDAY… HIS VOICE IS JUST *DOMAIN AMPLIFICATION* FOR MY BRAINROT 🎧🔥  

GOONING TO GOJO’S *”YOU WANNA SEE ME GET SERIOUS?”* FACE LIKE—**AAAAAA** 🚨💢💢💢 I CAN’T EVEN *DOMAIN EXPANSION* IN PEACE WITHOUT HIS *”Nah, I’d win”* ECHOING IN MY SKULL… **HE’S THE STRONGEST FOR A REASON** AND THE REASON IS *MY MENTAL DECLINE* 🛐💞  

WHEN HE SAYS *”*Throughout Heaven and Earth, I alone am the honored one*”* I *LOSE IT*… SIR??? SIR???? YOU CAN’T JUST *INFINITY-CHAD* YOUR WAY INTO MY SOUL AND LEAVE ME IN *LIMBO* LIKE THIS… **I’M JUST A WEAK LITTLE CURSE USER** 🧎‍♂️💔  

GOJO’S *”I would’ve won”* HAUNTS ME IN THE SHOWER… IN MY DREAMS… IN THE *VOID*… **I’M NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR THIS GLORY** 😩✋💫
